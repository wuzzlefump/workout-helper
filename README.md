## Creating Your Own Version

- do a git clone of the repo
- make yourself an .env.local file using .env.template as a reference
- make yourself a Sanity Project
- create an api token for your sanity project
- update your .env.local file to reflect your sanity project Id and token

## Getting Started

First Install Your Packages using

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

\* Note you will need to populate some data in your sannity studio to avoid any errors

\*\* you can enter your sanity studio here http://localhost:3000/studio

\*\*\* some data changes from your sanity project will not reflect on the page immediately, if so refresh your cache for the page
